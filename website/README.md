# JEV Lab website

The community fork uses a new SVG identity and a hosted-JEV getting-started page (`jev.html`). Authenticated JEV calls run in Python; the browser playground remains the public Featherless Simple Jev demo. `assets/jev-mark.svg`, `jev-banner.svg` and `jev-architecture.svg` are the new editable visuals.

Deployment is opt-in. Set repository variables `DEPLOY_WEBSITE=true`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT`, and the secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for your own hosting. This fork does not target upstream production by default.

## Existing playground implementation

A demo-first design for Simple Jev. Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no build, framework, keys, or website backend.

The dedicated [API documentation](docs.html) covers the request contract, all three question types, response interpretation, runnable client examples, errors, and self-hosting differences.

## Editable live playground

Visitors can load customer support, product review, or community moderation scenarios. Each scenario includes several example contexts and an editable starting question set. Loading a scenario explicitly replaces the context and questions; choosing a context preset only changes the context.

The question editor supports:

- Adding common question examples or writing a custom question.
- Editing answer IDs, question types, and instructions.
- Choice options as `answer_id | optional description`, one per line.
- Score rubrics in low-to-high order, one level per line.
- Noul yes/no propositions, returned as support for “yes.”
- Removing questions and running up to six questions per demo request.

Requests update immediately in the JSON inspector, but editing never sends context to the API. Run submits the current valid request. Blank questions, duplicate answer IDs, duplicate choice IDs, and invalid criteria counts are rejected locally. All questions share the demo's 2k-token context budget; six is a UI cap, not an API-wide limit.

Results are rendered from the submitted question definitions, including arbitrary answer IDs and rubric lengths. Scores display their exact expected zero-based level and a rubric distribution. Every edit clears previous results. There are no simulated initial scores.

## Preview

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory website
```

Open the [playground](http://127.0.0.1:8765/) or the [API documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs.html). Serving over HTTP/HTTPS is recommended; do not rely on opening the HTML through `file://`.

## API behavior

The client uses `https://simple-jev-demo-api.featherless.ai/v1/models` and `/v1/classifier`, with Qwen3.6-35B-A3B selected initially. The model list is fetched on load. Context is sent only after a visitor presses Run (or explicitly invokes the page's `run_classifier` WebMCP tool).

The API allows cross-origin browser requests and requires no authentication. The page displays the demo's 2k-token context and 4 RPS limits. A 1,200-character input cap is a UI convenience, not a token-count guarantee; the API enforces its real context limit. Requests time out after 45 seconds, double submission is blocked, and HTTP 429 activates a retry cooldown. The page never fabricates a successful response when the API fails.

The optional, feature-detected WebMCP tools share the visible UI actions: `stage_classifier_message` only edits the form, while `run_classifier` sends the request. Unsupported browsers ignore this integration. No analytics, local storage, or client-side secret is used. The public API's own data handling is separate from this page.

## Hosting

Serve this folder's public files from any static host and point `simple-jev.com` to that host when ready. There is no build step. Deploy `index.html`, `demos.html`, `playground.html`, `syntax.js`, `styles.css`, `demo.js`, `playground.mjs`, `docs.html`, `docs.css`, `docs.js`, and `assets/`; the README is not needed. Use HTTPS. This work does not configure DNS or publish the domain.

The live API model list and one real classification were checked during development. The static page also includes loading, validation, network-error, and rate-limit handling. Classification correctness depends on the selected model; demo outputs are not benchmark results.

## Gemma mixed-question diagnostic

On 2026-09-18, the original App outage preset reproduced an API-side error with `featherless-ai/gemma-4-26B-A4B-classifier`, including in direct HTTP requests outside the browser:

| Questions in the request | Observed result                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Routing + urgency        | HTTP 200                                |
| Refund (Noul) alone      | HTTP 200                                |
| All three together       | HTTP 422: `Expected nine finite logits` |

The combined browser request also returned `Expected one finite logit per choice` on a later attempt. These are API-side answer-scoring failures; the underlying serving bug has not been established. The successful isolated requests above are observations, not a guarantee that isolated calls always succeed. The page preserves the error JSON for inspection/copying and distinguishes this scoring error from a context-length problem. It does not silently switch models, replace Noul with another question type, or manufacture scores. Other inputs, including the Double charge preset, have returned successfully on Gemma.

## Production playground connection

Select Production, enter a Featherless API key, and run a classification. Both modes use the public demo’s `/v1/models` catalog without authentication. Production classification uses `https://api.featherless.ai/v1/classifier` with Bearer authentication. The refresh button reloads the shared demo model list. The key stays in page memory, is excluded from the JSON inspector and copy controls, and is cleared when returning to the demo. Authenticated requests reject redirects. No key is saved to browser storage. Production requests use the account’s limits and billing; the playground retains its 1,200-character and six-question UI caps. Production authentication requires your own key and was not live-tested with an account credential.

## Playable driving demo

Open [Simple Jev Pilot](http://127.0.0.1:8765/cool-demo/drive/) or use the Cool demos page. It adapts Standard Agents’ JevPilot to our public classifier API. Manual driving, three worlds, AI autopilot, and JSON inspection are available. Source and rebuild instructions are in `demos/jevpilot/README.md`; include `website/cool-demo/drive/` in static deployment. This demo has its own Vite build; other website pages remain build-free.

## Playable 2048

The Cool demos page links to `/cool-demo/2048/`. This build-free game supports keyboard, swipe, and button controls, one AI move or continuous play, model selection, and Gemma/Qwen image input. It calls the public demo directly and stores usage only in page memory. Include `cool-demo/2048/` when deploying the website. See its README for implementation and validation details.

## Shared game navigation

Both 2048 and the driving simulator load `shared/demo-header.js`, providing the Simple Jev home link, Cool demos, Playground, and API docs. Include `shared/` when deploying. The driving source references the shared script externally so changing navigation does not require rebuilding the simulator.

## Bookmark sorter

`/cool-demo/bookmarks/` accepts a local Netscape-format browser export (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge), selects at most 30 links, and sends one shared-context request with 30 choice questions to the public demo API. It rejects files over 5 MB, scans at most 10,000 anchors, and bounds/normalizes title and URL input before building the request. The export stays in the browser; only the selected titles and URLs are sent when the visitor runs the classifier. Include `cool-demo/bookmarks/` and `shared/` when deploying.

## Vision catalog demo

`/cool-demo/vision/` classifies the full 11-photo catalog with Gemma or Qwen. Four images share each API request. Batches run serially with a short delay and bounded HTTP 429 retries that honor Retry-After. Cancel preserves completed results. Source credits are in `catalog.json`. Include `cool-demo/vision/` in deployment; no build is needed.

## Production deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` publishes to Cloudflare Pages in **Recursal PROD** when `main` receives changes under `website/`, `demos/jevpilot/`, or the deployment workflow. You can also run **Deploy website** manually from GitHub Actions on `main`.

Configure the repository Actions secret `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with **Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit**, restricted to Recursal PROD. The workflow supplies the PROD account ID and deploys to the `simple-jev` project (`https://simple-jev-6i4.pages.dev`). DNS and custom domains are managed separately; deployments update the existing project.

The workflow installs locked dependencies, runs website tests and the driving API adapter tests, rebuilds the driving simulator, and stages the website without tests or README files. The deployment token is supplied only to the upload step. No local Cloudflare login is required by CI.
